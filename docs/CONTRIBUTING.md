## We need you

ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to redgnus! We love contributions from the community,
feedback and new ideas. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

It is a pleasure for us to have you here. Your help is needed and
highly appreciated. Here are some hints where to start, and how...

This project is intended to be a safe and welcoming space for teams
and individuals aiming at improving it through their collaboration.
Contributors are expected to adhere to these [Community Guidelines].

If you encounter abusive behavior, please refer to the [Enforcement]
section (aka Policy Violation) of the Community Guidelines (aka Code
of Conduct) for information on how to raise a complaint (PM [redtux]).

## Environment setup

We kindly ask all contributors to stick to the project layout and
directory structure both for new and for existing projects inside
the `redgnus` namespace. Use these linters before each new commit.

- [ ] [actionlint] (linter for GitHub Actions)
- [x] [dotenv-linter] (linter for `.env` files)
- [x] [editorconfig-checker] (linter using `.editorconfig`)
- [ ] [markdownlint] (linter for markdown files)
- [ ] [MegaLinter] (linter collection for CI/CD pipelines)
- [x] [shellcheck] (linter for shell scripts)
- [x] [yamllint] (linter for yaml files)
- [ ] [hadolint] (linter for `Dockerfile`)

A working development environment is being initiated by the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The used linting tools can also be installed manually by the following commands:

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade pip
pip3 install --user dotenv-linter
pip3 install --user editorconfig-checker
pip3 install --user hadolintw
pip3 install --user mkdocs-material
pip3 install --user mkdocs-with-pdf
pip3 install --user shellcheck-py
pip3 install --user yamllint
pip3 install --user wheel
pip3 install --user git+git://github.com/AleksaC/hadolint-py.git@v2.8.0
npm install -g markdownlint-cli
```

## Conventional commits

All redgnus projects follow the [Conventional Commits] specification. Therefore,
all commit messages must follow the [Angular style standard] as described below.

```bash
<type>[(scope)]: Subject
[Body]
```

Scope and body are optional. Type can be:

- `build`: About packaging, building wheels, etc.
- `chore`: About packaging or repo/files management.
- `ci`: About Continuous Integration.
- `docs`: About documentation.
- `feat`: New feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `perf`: About performance.
- `refactor`: Changes which are not features nor bug fixes.
- `style`: A change in code style/format.
- `tests`: About tests.

**Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown.**
If you write a body, please add issues references at the end:

```bash
Body.
See #10, #11
Close #15
```

## Pull requests guidelines

Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message.

During review, we recommend using fixups:

```bash
# SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix
git commit --fixup=SHA
```

Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits:

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash main
```

Then you should push your changes to the remote origin repository:

```bash
git push
```
