## About

> **redgnus ✨ 100% FREE SOFTWARE**

- [x] 👋 Hi and welcome to the redgnus project! Visit us at [redgnus.github.io].
- [x] 👀 We are interested in building ✨Free Software✨ for a ✨Free Society✨.
- [x] 🌱 We are currently learning how to build a private cloud on Raspberry Pi.
- [x] 💞️ We are looking to collaborate with you on building our redgnus stack...
- [x] 📫 Feel free to contact us at <<vwb4yxi6w@mozmail.com>>, or via [twitter].

## Templates

NOTE: We are using TODO-Driven Development - which
might be comparable to [Readme Driven Development][RDD].

[RDD]: https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

New code repositories should start with a readme defining at least the following:

- [ ] Mission: Principal aims and visions of the project
- [ ] Features: Some ideas or a wishlist for the project
- [ ] Tools: Build tools and dev environment - if needed

Using a `TODO.md` file for major tasks to keep track of progress is recommended.
