## Templates

NOTE: This project uses TODO-Driven Development - which
might be comparable to [Readme Driven Development][RDD].

[RDD]: https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

Start a code repository by writing a README, defining at least the following:

- [ ] Mission: Principal aims and `visions` of the project
- [ ] Features: Some ideas or a `wishlist` for the project
- [ ] Tools: Build tools and `dev environment` - if needed

For major milestones, start with a `TODO.md` file, and keep track of progress.
