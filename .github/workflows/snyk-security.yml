# A workflow with support for the full Snyk platform:
# - Snyk Open Source
# - Snyk Code
# - Snyk Container
# - Snyk Infrastructure as Code

# The setup installs the Snyk CLI - for more details on the possible commands
# @see https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/cli-reference
# @see https://github.com/snyk/actions/
# The results of Snyk Code are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning
#
# To use the Snyk Action we need to have a Snyk API token:
# @see https://github.com/snyk/actions#getting-your-snyk-token
